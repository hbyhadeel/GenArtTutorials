Babe, you're too controlling
I'ma feed you to the wolves when you get nasty back at me
But baby, don't distract me
I'm a goner, I lost her
Like, why the hell you wanna play me that way?
You're bad, babe, you double-faced entendre
Life goes on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and
On, and on, and on
On, and on, and on, and on, and on, and
On and on and on
On, and on, and on, and on, and on, and
On, and on, and on
On, and on, and on, and on, and on, and
On, and on, and on
Babe, you best believe it, I'ma rip you up to pieces
I'm a lover, not a fighter, but I'll light this place on fire
I want it, I'm on it, but babe, at least, I'm honest
I get tired of explaining
As these seasons keep on changing
Life goes on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and
On, and on, and on (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
On, and on, and on, and on, and on, and
On, and on, and on (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
On, and on, and on, and on, and on, and
On, and on, and on (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
On, and on, and on, and on, and on, and
On, and on, and on (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Work all day, and then I wake up
Work all day, and then I wake up
Work all day, and then I wake up
Work all day (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Work all day, and then I wake up
Work all day, and then I wake up
Work all day, and then I wake up
Work all day
